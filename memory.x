   * [Mass Production Reminder]
   * It is feasible to consider switching to the STM32G030C6Tx chip
   * for the purpose of addressing supply availability and cost reduction.
   * However, please be aware that the current debug build exceeds the 32KB
   * limit for the flash section.
   * As a result, this change would be applicable only when transitioning
   * to the release build for mass production.
   *
   * If you wish to proceed with the change to STM32G030C6Tx,
   * please modify the FLASH LENGTH to 32KB.
