# `billmock-app-rs`

Rust Embedded firmware using **rust embedded-hal**<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> and **embassy-rs**<sup>[2](#footnote_1)</sup> on **STM32G030C8**<sup>[3](#footnote_1)</sup> MCU for Billmock product.

Used rust experimentally.

This repository is aiming three goal.
One for development of production firmware and second is making a proof of concept that rust embedded is usable for actual embedded production. And last goal is setting some example about production-rust-embedded-code.

**This project is currently under development, with ongoing QA testing and some optimization remaining.**

## Billmock
Detail documentation is here [BillMock Manual](https://billmock.pmnxis.net/)

It is hardware and software for the purpose of converting I/O signals related to money payment of arcade game machines for compatibility.

This project began development at the request of **GPARK Co., Ltd**<sup>[4](#footnote_1)</sup> and was designed and developed for the using credit card readers in arcade game machine and compatibility of existing payment systems (open-drain-based), and is open to the public except for code in the NDA area.
The project has been granted an open source disclosure except of NDA era.

## Target Hardware
Based on BillMock-HW 0.5 mini, 0.4 mini and 0.4. <br/>
0.2 and 0.3 HW bring-up codes are still left for recyle the old PCB.
- 0.2 HW has different gpio configuration compare to latest boards.
- 0.3 HW has minor bugs, floating on VendSide-Inhibit and missing net route on VendSide-1P-StartJam.
- 0.4 HW fixed 0.3 HW bugs.
- 0.4 HW mini reduced BOM for mass-manufacturing
- 0.5 HW mini added tact switch for SVC mode call

Current default HW is `0.5 mini`. If need to use old 0.4 or 0.4 mini, following below command lines
```sh
cargo build --features hw_0v4 --no-default-features --release
cargo build --features hw_mini_0v4 --no-default-features --release
```
