# `billmock-app-rs`

Rust Embedded firmware using **rust embedded-hal**<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> and **embassy-rs**<sup>[2](#footnote_1)</sup> on **STM32G030C8**<sup>[3](#footnote_1)</sup> MCU for Billmock product.

Used rust experimentally.

This repository is aiming three goal.
One for development of production firmware and second is making a proof of concept that rust embedded is usable for actual embedded production. And last goal is setting some example about production-rust-embedded-code.

**This project is still under the development, not working yet**

## Billmock
It is hardware and software for the purpose of converting I/O signals related to money payment of arcade game machines for compatibility.

This project began development at the request of **GPARK Co., Ltd**<sup>[4](#footnote_1)</sup> and was designed and developed for the using credit card readers in arcade game machine and compatibility of existing payment systems (open-drain-based), and is open to the public except for code in the NDA area.
The project has been granted an open source disclosure except of NDA era.

## Dependencies
See details here [dependencies](doc/dependencies.md)

### NDA Dependencies
To build with NDA features (GPARK Limited or own secret dependency), need adding following command on each `cargo` command.
build, run or any other `cargo` command.

```sh
# dependency injection from git repository
--config 'patch.crates-io.serial-arcade-pay-impl.git = "https://github.com/your_name/your_own_library.git"'

# dependency injection from local repository
--config 'patch.crates-io.serial-arcade-pay-impl.path = "../local_my_repo"'
```

In this repository, experimentally utilize dependency injection that the 'patch' function of 'cargo' to coexist both NDA code and open source example code.
