# 개발자 매뉴얼

# Write In Rust
Used rust experimentally.

This repository is aiming three goal.
One for development of production firmware and second is making a proof of concept that rust embedded is usable for actual embedded production. And last goal is setting some example about production-rust-embedded-code.

The software code is in [billmock-app-rs](https://github.com/pmnxis/billmock-app-rs) , except NDA related code.
