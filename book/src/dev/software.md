## Card Terminal Connectivity in actual environment
 The firmware being developed is based on KICC's ED-785 terminal for mass production. However, in accordance with the NDA agreement, the code related to this is not present in the public codebase. Instead, it is managed separately through dependency injection. Therefore, the publicly available source code contains only example protocol code that does not actually perform any real operations.
