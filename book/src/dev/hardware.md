# Hardware 

![Actual BillMock PCB 0v4](https://billmock.gpark.biz/images/BillMockPCB_0v4.jpg)

There are currently four hardware revisions available: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.4 Mini. Development is being carried out specifically for the 0.4 and 0.4 Mini revisions, which are the ones that are actually usable.

To check pin mappings or installation details, please refer to the desired section in the table of contents on the left.

For detailed hardware schematics, you can refer to [BillMock-HW-RELEASE](https://github.com/pmnxis/BillMock-HW-RELEASE).
