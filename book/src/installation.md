# Machine installation
When connecting to actual arcade machines, there are two installation options available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended to test both methods and select the one that best suits your needs.

1. Assuming there is some flexibility in the cable length, cut the cable at the installation point.
2. Strip the insulation from both ends of the cut cable, leaving approximately 1cm (10mm) of exposed wire.
3. While pressing the orange latch on the top/bottom terminal, securely insert the stripped wire into the hole.

- Note: Typically, the top side should be connected to the actual currency payment device, while the bottom side should be connected to the GAME I/O PCB.
- Note: Ensure there is some length flexibility in the existing cables.
- Note: Only cables conforming to UL/CUL standards with AWG20 or higher and AWG26 or lower can be used with these terminals.
